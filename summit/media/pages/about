The 6th MIT Sustainability Summit has the theme of “Coastal Cities – Sustainable Future”. Coastal cities are caught at the nexus of three forces that dominate the 21st century: rapid urbanization, climate change and destabilization, and continued integration of the global economy. These cities exhibit confounding duality. They grew at the boundary of sea and land and are shaped by the tension this geography brings. They are simultaneously threatened by the capriciousness of climate change and integral to networks of global trade. If coastal cities can navigate a transition towards sustainability and resilience, it may offer a path forward for the rest of the planet. This conference challenges traditional notions of urban development to ask how coastal cities can be the key to global sustainability. Our objective with the 2014 Sustainability Summit is to engage the audience with the coastal city sustainability challenge by bringing experienced and knowledgeable speakers, using interactive workshops, providing the opportunity to brainstorm on real sustainability problems from cities and companies, and bringing together a diverse audience with expertise and interest in sustainable solutions for coastal cities futures. Our event is a legacy of sustainability focused initiatives within MIT community in cooperation with our sponsors, participants, and community. We invite you to join us at the 2014 MIT Sustainability Summit and be part of the sustainable future of your city.
