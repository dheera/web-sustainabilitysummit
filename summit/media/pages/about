The 7th Annual Sustainability Summit will focus on understanding&mdash;and offering solutions to&mdash;the complex problems facing local and global agriculture systems. This year’s Summit will tackle food and farming challenges through the lens of the “Circular Economy,” a systems-thinking approach that demonstrates that a flourishing, sustainable world is built on intentionally cycling resources between production and consumption: from farm to table and back again.
