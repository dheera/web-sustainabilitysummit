            <column name="description">Much of the 20th century's social and economic development was built on mythological foundations—for instance:
- The idea that the earth is a subsidiary of our economies--there for the taking and dumping
- The idea that the earth is infinitely resilient to withstand humans' abuses
Even the very fundamental allowance in our economic theories for &quot;externalities&quot; means that often no one is held accountable for the direct consequences of economic activities that do not appear on income statements or balance sheets.

Another myth is that food can be cheap. The problem with this idea is that in fact we now know there are significant nutritional, environmental and social costs incurred in the production of so-called cheap food--we just don't pay them at the supermarket check-out. The net result of businesses and an overall economic system that are founded on myths is that economic success for one party or constituency is always at the expense of another. Someone or something always pays when one party wins.This presentation will examine one company's 28-year effort to address these myths head-on; to seek solutions that internalize externalities to the greatest extent possible and that create Win-Win-Win-Win formulae in which the conditions for all stakeholders—shareholders, employees, farmers, consumers, even livestock—can be enhanced. This is not only about how we can and must THINK differently, but also about proven ACTIONS and RESULTS that can encourage us all to embrace sustainability goals in all that we do.</column>

            <column name="description">Kristin founded Sansori because our times call for a reimagining of the American ideal – the idea that each person, regardless of one's color, gender, or class, has a gift to share and contribute toward the common good. She envisions a global model of education that lives up to this ideal, embracing all women and men around the world, breaking down barriers and transforming lives. Through Sansori, where students gain tools for financial, organizational, and inner sustainability and launch social enterprises, Kristin hopes to collaborate with others who are transforming the world. At Sansori, Kristin is integrating the best of both private and not-for-profit experiences she's had. She was president of AllLearn, an online educational venture among Oxford, Stanford, and Yale Universities, that served over 11,000 students from over 75 countries. As Director for New Initiatives for Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, she was instrumental in developing the Women's Leadership Board. She also practiced law at Simpson Thacher &amp;amp; Bartlett's New York and London offices, and specialized in international capital market transactions. Kristin received her J.D. from Harvard Law School and her A.B. from Bryn Mawr College, cum laude, in Chinese Philosophy. She currently serves on the Board of RAIT Investment Trust (NYSE: RAS). She has also served on the Board of Trustees of Bryn Mawr College and many other non-profit boards.</column>

            <column name="description">Justin McClellan is the Aerospace Analysis Group Lead at Aurora Flight Sciences R&amp;D Center.  He focuses on the design and development of piloted and autonomous aerospace systems. His design experience includes interplanetary spacecraft, 5-year endurance solar airplanes, high-altitude airplanes, passenger and military transport aircraft. Recently McClellan led a year-long study on feasibility and cost of using aerospace vehicles for Geoengineering flights to the stratosphere. His team worked with climate scientists to design aerospace fleets that can deliver millions of tons of reflective mist to high altitude. There the mist reflects away some of the suns heat, cooling surface temperatures about a degree or two. The results of the study were featured in The Economist and McClellan has been interviewed by National Geographic Television.  Prior to Aurora, McClellan was an aerospace systems engineer at AeroAstro Inc and earned a BS in Aerospace Engineering in 2004 from Boston University. He will finish his Executive MBA at Boston University in 2013.</column>

            <column name="description">Helen Lochhead is currently executive director, Place Development at Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority and an adjunct professor at Sydney University. She is an architect and urban designer who combines teaching and practice. Her career has focused on the inception, planning and delivery of complex multidisciplinary projects ranging from a 5-year city improvements program for the City of Sydney to major urban renewal and waterfront projects. Sustainability is a key driver in her work, and working in the public sector, she is mindful of how government as a builder of urban environments can lead by example to make sustainability gains and deliver multiple benefits on a broad scale.

Lochhead has been instrumental in shaping major precincts around Sydney Harbour, including the transformation of Sydney Olympic Park at Homebush Bay from a sports precinct into a mixed-use community and parklands with environmental credentials that set new benchmarks. She oversaw the Harold Park Master Plan for a new high density neighborhood on Rozelle Bay. With over 1000 new dwellings and 25% affordable housing, the project maintains heritage buildings, has 35% open space, improves the hydrology and biodiversity of this flood prone land and achieves ambitious environmental targets. Currently she is leading a 30 year plan for the transformation of Sydney Cove.

In her present role Lochhead’s focus has shifted from specific projects to the broader context--interagency coordination and the mechanisms to achieve integrated outcomes around Sydney’s foreshores. As a Loeb Fellow she will study policy, design, strategic leadership and governance strategies that enable disparate interests to realize a shared vision in order to deliver more sustainable climate resilient coastal cities.</column>

            <column name="description">As firms respond to stakeholder concerns about sustainability, they often find that their greatest environmental and socioeconomic impacts are in parts of their value chain outside their direct control. Distant decisions about farming practices, factory labor conditions, and household consumer behavior can create substantial risks and opportunities for businesses in the middle of the chain. Smart companies interested in securing supply, reducing costs, staying ahead of regulation, and enhancing brand and reputation must develop new capabilities: to &quot;see&quot; the larger value-creating systems they are part of creating and understand value chain impacts; to collaboratively engage value chain partners in mutual learning and continuous improvement, especially those who hold different mental models and goals; and to build shared visions of healthy and sustainable value chains and strategically support pre-competitive efforts at systemic change. Without intentional strategies for building diverse leadership networks based on these core capabilities, transformative strategic intentions will never crystallize and get translated into new practices and results.</column>

            <column name="description">System dynamics is a methodology for studying and managing complex feedback systems, such as one finds in business and other social systems. In fact it has been used to address practically every sort of feedback system. While the word system has been applied to all sorts of situations, feedback is the differentiating descriptor here. Feedback refers to the situation of X affecting Y and Y in turn affecting X perhaps through a chain of causes and effects. One cannot study the link between X and Y and, independently, the link between Y and X and predict how the system will behave. Only the study of the whole system as a feedback system will lead to correct results. (Source: System Dynamics Society) In this session we will give you an overview of systems dynamics, the methodology to use it and discuss some key examples of how system dynamics can improve decision-making around environmental and social issues.</column>

At times the problem is not how to overcome obstacles that prevent a more sustainable way of living, but imagining what a sustainable world will look like in the first place. We will need truly innovative solutions to shift our habitual dependence on old ways of Industrial Age life.

One approach to breakthrough innovations is open source systems. For example, free software distributed and continuously developed by online communities, information and data organized by a collective group, or competitions in which ideas and solutions are crowdsourced from the public. How can open source systems be used to solve the hard yet unavoidable problems we face in preserving our planet? More importantly, how can the open source approach lead to innovative solutions in sustainability and new ways of 21st Century life?</column>

            <column name="description">Leveraging individual behavior to address sustainability concerns is potentially the fastest and cheapest way to create lasting societal change. Case studies, particularly in the energy sector, have shown that by complementing technological, political and economic action with behavioral theory, organizations can create in deeper systemic transformations. To achieve this change, harnessing the power of individual action is crucial, but developing and distributing effective messaging to motivate action can be a daunting challenge. The interactions between individuals, messages, and media are many, complex, and in high competition for everyone's attention. Therefore, the drivers and motivators of any audience provides the fundamental building blocks of successful behavior change strategy.

This workshop will introduce participants to some of the primary drivers and motivators behind people's actions. Through a combination of small-group activities and larger discussions, the following questions will be addressed.
- How can behavior change strategy improve sustainability communications?
- What tools exist to understand and influence behavior change?
- How does behavior change fit into the larger picture of sustainable development?</column>

            <column name="description">Many investors today are demanding much more from their investments than just financial return. Investors have become increasingly interested in maximizing social good without sacrificing portfolio diversification or financial performance. Investment strategies range from screening out companies that engage in questionable practices to proactively investing in companies that consistently promote environmental stewardship, social justice, and good corporate governance. According to Ceres, a national network of investors and environmental groups, long-term investors see sustainability performance as an indicator of strong management and long-term strategy for future growth. In other words, many investors are starting to see social investments as good business opportunities.

How do players in the social investment space effectively engage with key stakeholders such as sustainable companies, investors, competitors, social and environmental groups, local communities, and others benefiting from the investments? How do you increase transparency to ensure that the social investments are truly making a difference for all key stakeholders? In this session, we will explore these questions and have a discussion on how we, as a society, might prioritize our investments to maximize both positive social impact and financial return.</column>

They all draw on natural resources to produce products, and they all dispose of waste on the same finite planet. What else? What crossover is there between disparate industries and what can they learn from each other? How do their definitions of sustainability lead them to implement sustainability initiatives in different ways? Companies in the same or similar sectors usually look to each other to learn about best practices. The purpose of the session is to showcase innovative organizations in varied sectors that support sustainable supply chains and to cross-pollinate best practices. The panel aims to challenge the participants to consider how it is that an industry's definition of sustainability drives its actions.</column>

            <column name="description">Positive waste reduction efforts such as improved recycling programs and renewable material innovations indicate that trash is receiving greater widespread attention, but there is still much work to be done. Waste streams and material life cycles are a mystery to most, making the &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot; mentality the common mode of thinking about trash. This highlights the need to explicate the complex cycles related to the effects of consumption, meaning where products come from and where they end up. Building on last year's &quot;Closed Loop 101&quot; discussion that questioned the feasibility of reaching zero waste, this year's panel will focus on turning the idea into practice. Distinguished professionals across disciplines ranging from media to the public sector will share key strategies, personal accounts, pivotal moments, and lessons learned on their path to adopting zero-waste approaches.</column>

            <column name="description">This year's MIT Sustainability Summit afternoon keynote will be delivered by Katherine Gajewski, Director of the Mayor's Office of Sustainability for the City of Philadelphia. She will speak about her office's efforts to implement the ambitious and far-reaching Greenworks Philadelphia plan, which targets improvements in energy efficiency, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, green infrastructure, and green economy jobs, among others. She will speak about successes and challenges both in achieving the goals of the plan and in developing new relationships with stakeholders both inside and outside of government necessary for the plan to be successful.</column>

            <column name="description">Our global economy is linked together by phenomenally large and complex multi-modal logistics chains, moving raw materials, finished products, and waste around the world with astounding reliability, speed, and environmental impact. In the United States, new models of delivery are bringing the near-instant gratification of brick-and-mortar shopping to the convenience of online retail. As consumers increasingly demand sustainable products and practices, how are manufacturers and retailers (both brick &amp; mortar and online) altering their logistics operations in response while maintaining the service levels their customers expect? What roles do transport and supply chain logistics play in a sustainable future? And what role can sustainability play in transport and supply chain logistics decisions?</column>

            <column name="description">As is commonly cited, the world has reached an urbanization tipping point. While cities take up approximately 2% of landmass worldwide they represent  over half of global population, two-thirds of the world's energy usage, and over 70% of the world's carbon emissions. Due to these impacts and the on-the-ground experience of climate change, city leaders are leading the world to a more sustainable future. While national governments have been slow to navigate the difficulties of climate change politics, urban innovators form the public, academic, and private sectors are making material progress. In addition to bold new ideas, however, sustainable change at the urban scale requires innovative partnerships between agencies and actors. During this session, attendees will hear from both thinkers and doers at a variety of scales who have developed creative solutions to pressing sustainability challenges while utilizing innovative partnerships to achieve their success.</column>

            <column name="description">In the face of weakening international resolve for traditional top-down approaches to great global sustainability challenges such as climate change, bottom-up voluntary commitments may represent an increasingly important mode for stimulating action. The UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) held in June 2012, for example, generated by some counts over $600 billion in new commitments toward sustainability, from governments, private sector, civil society and development banks. Other venues such as the Major Economies Forum have promise to stimulate real action on climate change by the world’s largest emitters. Panelists will discuss some of the major voluntary commitment models, outcomes of Rio+20, as well as mechanisms to track and generate more progress from all actors.</column>

            <column name="description">The flourishing of human and other life on earth forever. Sounds like a good idea, doesn’t it? It is a possibility that catches our attention, and inspires us amid the intense challenges of unsustainability in our economy and society. And at the same time, it makes us uneasy, like “is that really possible? How can we possibly get there?” What is the pathway? We might feel particularly skeptical if we’re in the muck as innovators and advocates, trying to convince people to “get on the bus” and facing all kinds of resistance and defense of the status quo.

We’ve got some bad news and some good news. The bad news is that the doubt, resistance and defensiveness we encounter are our own fault. As much as we might think the enemy is a &quot;they&quot; – the 1%, the fossil fuel companies, the politicians, the climate deniers – we can be our own worst enemy. When people think of us as “environmental whackos” it may be… because we are! We lunge forward with our passion and dedication and we tumble into pitfalls of activism – self-righteousness, ideology, blame, and despair. How’s that for flourishing? The good news is that we think there are pathways around those pitfalls. These are habits of living, speaking, relating, organizing, and innovating that massively increase our effectiveness, take us beyond preaching and whining to “the choir,” and allow us to have a lot of fun in the process. But we’ve got to figure them out together.

So this is a conversation. It is hosted by two young advocates for sustainability who are willing to poke fun at themselves, and inviting others to join in the fun. We’ll share the pitfalls and pathways we’ve identified, share our stories, and invite you to share yours. We believe the result of this conversation can be profound - a transformation of the sustainability movement, making it a context for the flourishing of our lives on the way to the flourishing of all life.</column>

Major highways, sea- and airports are located in coastal cities, and serve as crucial links in the movement and distribution of goods. As crucial as the role costal cities play in the global supply chain is, there are major challenges to face as coastal cities struggle to balance commerce growth with infrastructure resiliency and environmental concerns. How will the future of supply chain technology address capacity, resiliency, efficiency and environmental concerns in coastal cities? What are current and future trends in supply chain design and what role do coastal cities play in these designs? What are the economic, social and environmental implications of these trends for coastal cities? This session pulls together a multi-disciplinary panel that draws experts from academia, government, and the private sector to explore these ideas. This session will illuminate the coastal city’s role in a sustainable supply chain as well as the challenges to achieving that vision.</column>

            <column name="description">Currently, there is a growing discussion about expanding infrastructure for urban resilience. Traditionally, major infrastructure projects have been primarily funded by government institutions, but the private sector is playing an increasingly important role. What Is the business opportunity in these inherently risky regional projects? Leaders in infrastructure investment, climate insurance, and asset management will gather to share their current approach and their expectations of future trends in infrastructure development. In this session we will explore how infrastructure is funded now and in the future and how that could ultimately impact our everyday levels of utility services and costs.</column>

With the expansion of global trade and the rise in coastal populations, we now ask more of the sea than ever before.  How are traditional coastal industries evolving as new industries establish their footholds, and what systemic strategies exist for managing coastal development? This panel examines from the perspectives of industry players along the coast as well as port regulator / operator with the attempt to find that balance amongst busineses, food production and even the provision of water while protecting our oceanic resources.</column>

            <column name="description">The livelihood of a city depends heavily on its ability to deliver safe and reliable power to the community. The challenge is especially great where coastal cities are concerned. The nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan in 2011 and the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 both highlighted how coastal cities are especially fragile. This panel examines where and how resilience can be built into the energy system, and how private and public institutions can create and capture value along the chain. Recognizing that a low-carbon economy is a key solution for mitigating the effects of climate change, panelists will also explore opportunities to drive green development in coastal cities and beyond.</column>

Setting a science-based carbon target is difficult, requiring taking into account the city's contribution to global GDP, its growth rate, and other factors. This model makes the process of setting carbon targets based on science dramatically faster and easier, without sacrificing the ability to set a strong goal. This means that targets can be set by municipalities without requiring a lot of time or a large budget, bringing real carbon targets within reach for cities around the world. </column>

Since this time, the rate of recycling increase as a percentage of waste generation has leveled.  The Waste Management session brings together recycling business innovators and the public sector to discuss the amount of recyclable materials that are being disposed of, explore the innovative ways businesses and regulators are encouraging increased diversion from landfills, and examine market drivers and inhibitors.  The session will seek to illuminate the future of waste diversion and the business opportunities within it.  Participants will learn about opportunities to capitalize their recycling efforts and the economic and regulatory forces that may shape their waste management behavior in the future.</column>

This intensive role-play simulation will engage the Summit audience to actively explore research  questions such as: What are the climate change risks facing coastal communities? What can these communities do to manage or adapt to these risks? What will it take to build informed agreements in each community about the appropriate steps to take? How can “playing of tailored role play games” build a shared sense of the collective risk management steps that should be taken? 

We anticipate that this workshop will provide valuable insights into techniques for engaging communities in public learning, risk management, and collaborative decision-making. We also hope that participants will be able to build on what we learn as they help their own local communities prepare for climate change.</column>
