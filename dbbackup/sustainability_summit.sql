The problem with this idea is that in fact we now know there are significant nutritional, environmental and social costs incurred in the production of so-called cheap food--we just don''t pay them at the supermarket check-out. The net result of businesses and an overall economic system that are founded on myths is that economic success for one party or constituency is always at the expense of another. Someone or something always pays when one party wins.This presentation will examine one company''s 28-year effort to address these myths head-on; to seek solutions that internalize externalities to the greatest extent possible and that create Win-Win-Win-Win formulae in which the conditions for all stakeholders—shareholders, employees, farmers, consumers, even livestock—can be enhanced.

Setting a science-based carbon target is difficult, requiring taking into account the city''s contribution to global GDP, its growth rate, and other factors. This model makes the process of setting carbon targets based on science dramatically faster and easier, without sacrificing the ability to set a strong goal. This means that targets can be set by municipalities without requiring a lot of time or a large budget, bringing real carbon targets within reach for cities around the world. ', 'SSR', 1611),

Since this time, the rate of recycling increase as a percentage of waste generation has leveled.  The Waste Management session brings together recycling business innovators and the public sector to discuss the amount of recyclable materials that are being disposed of, explore the innovative ways businesses and regulators are encouraging increased diversion from landfills, and examine market drivers and inhibitors.  The session will seek to illuminate the future of waste diversion and the business opportunities within it.  Participants will learn about opportunities to capitalize their recycling efforts and the economic and regulatory forces that may shape their waste management behavior in the future.', 'LH', 1605),

What can these communities do to manage or adapt to these risks? What will it take to build informed agreements in each community about the appropriate steps to take? How can “playing of tailored role play games” build a shared sense of the collective risk management steps that should be taken? \r\n\r\nWe anticipate that this workshop will provide valuable insights into techniques for engaging communities in public learning, risk management, and collaborative decision-making.
